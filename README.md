Introduction:

Cryptocurrency trading is full of opportunities for those who can act quickly and decisively. One such strategy is front-running, which involves executing a trade ahead of large transactions to capitalize on the anticipated price movements. While this technique can be highly profitable, identifying and acting on front-running opportunities manually is challenging.

Front-running is a trading strategy where you execute a trade based on advanced knowledge of a large upcoming transaction, which is likely to move the price of a cryptocurrency. For example, if a large buy order is about to be placed on a particular crypto asset, its price is likely to rise.

Whenever you use a decentralized exchange to swap tokens, the price of the token you buy increases slightly. This is called slippage and for most retail traders, slippage is barely even noticeable. Whale traders however, especially when they purchase highly illiquid tokens, can significantly change a token’s price.Frontrunning bots take advantage of this mechanic by beating out the trader on the gas fees, purchasing into a token at the lower price and then instantly selling them off at the higher price. In a block explorer, frontruns leave a clear trace with the trader’s transaction being sandwiched between the two frontrun transactions. #coding #frontrunningbot #javascript #tutorial #botv4 #dex #programming #configuration #learntocode #stepbystep #beginner
